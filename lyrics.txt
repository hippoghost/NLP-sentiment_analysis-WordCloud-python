USE
What I do for you it's true
Don't even think about it
I give you all my life when you
Can't live without it

Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high that's way

Give me, Give me, Give me
I'll never grow up no

The only thing I want from you
Is your goddamn addiction
But you don't want to hear
About my fucking revolution

Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high
Well I was getting high that's way

Give me, Give me, Give me
I'll never grow up no

Move it



I may be wrong
I may be right
But I feel so strong
I feel so wise
I could be lying dead
But I'm still alive
My self is leaving me
But I don't feel like cry

I know the message
That you can't explain
Running like dog again
Every night and day
I saw the light
And I'll find my way
I may be nothing
But we all just the same

But I can't complain
And I feel no pain
But I can't complain
And I feel no pain

I took the power
That you threw away
I've got you in my blood
You're in my brain
Everything ends but
Everything starts again
I won't come chasing
You find me one day

But I can't complain
And I feel no pain
But I can't complain
And I feel no pain




A super dose of pure nothing
God put last night in my fucking head
Although I was lost completely
Although I knew I had to stay ahead

And I know
I'm going right into the storm
And I know
I'm gone

This is the longest trip you've taking
The biggest dream you've ever gonna know
But if you want to live some more now
Get of my face I'm going to explode

And I know
I'm going right into the storm
And I know
I'm gone
And I know
I'm going right into the fucking storm
And I know
I'm gone



I know your name
I've seen your face
I can't forget
what you have done in this place

You look so good
You look so clean
But I'm gonna find out
what's under your skin

So, now it's my turn

You misunderstood
what I've offered to you
You lost your turn
So, make my day

So, here it comes
as bad as it looks
There is nowhere to run
It gonna get you anyway

So, now it's my turn

You wanna know what's going on
My turn, right or wrong





She is walking down the street alone
But she know she is been followed
The same shit you never know
But in a different color
She saw the light it was so big
It felt so worm when she touch it
She tried to take it away from me
She tried to steal what I've got

I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby
I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby

Hidden deep under her skin
Cover inside her veins now
Her body trembling from the heat
Her blood begins to boil now
You never know what hit you there
You never know what happened
Can't stop the fire inside your head
Can't kill the demon that killed you

I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby
I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby

And as I'm wondering
I heard a voice in my head
I didn't know what to expect
Didn't know what's the matter
The voice said to hide the light
So no can't ever find it
It's dangerous for little man
To mess with stuff that god send

I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby
I say hey hey what you say for all the love you giving baby




I would like to rule the world
Just to keep you pleased
I would like to have some more
I'll get down on my knees
So don't stay behind
Just break the line
See how far you can go
And tell me how it feels

This is u

I would like to be the dream
You dreaming in your sleep
I would like to be the air
You're breathing in so deep
So don't stay behind
Just break the line
See how far you can go
And tell me how it feels

This is u





Makes no difference
what you’re feeling now
Cause everything will change
They don’t care about you or your ways
They want to cause you pain

raw

A serpent is crawling
underneath your feet
It gonna steel your life
Stones are placed in a perfect circle
Don’t let it break the line

raw

Motherfuckers will get it like rain
Hot steel and the city block rage




I don't need a ring of solid gold now
To show me that you're a different man
For me you're not that important
I swear babe I don't give a damn

Damn, damn
What the motherfuck you're doing
You're going down
You wanna stay high

Damn, damn
What the motherfuck you're doing
You're going down
You wanna stay alive

Your soul is gold I'm sure I've got it
Who cares about the flesh you wear
I'm gonna drive you into my hell
It's hot in there, you'll fry your brains in there

Already dead and you don't know it
You are fucked up since the day you were born
I'll pull the trigger man, I'll help you
Make sure the bullet has your name on it










RITUAL
I know you come from the damned
You give too much to pretend
You don't know what life's about
Go spit on some other ground

Don't have to worry
About the problems that you never had
Running with yourself
And always win the second the second the prize

I know you come from the damned
You give too much to pretend
You don't know what life's about
Go spit on some other ground

Leave me alone
I don't wanna hear you any more
And when you leave
Please take the garbage out the door

I know you come from the damned
You give too much to pretend
You don't know what life's about
Go spit on some other ground



How happy you must be right now that you gave a birth to these little gentle creatures
I don't know how you managed to do this but I tell you why it looks so evil
Cause I don't know what you mean about the world of freedom
There are people who use people everyday
It looks so hard to believe you made us like your image
Tell me what your name is
What your name is

Life pasts faster than you thought and in the end it's all the same it doesn't make a difference
In the beginning it didn't look so hard some times you lose some times you win
Cause I don't know what you mean with the life you giving
There are people who use people everyday
It looks so hard to believe you made us like your image
Tell me what your name is
What your name is





You don't know what's right or wrong with it
But you need to set your mind free
Life is an illusion too
I'll keep an eye on you

You don't know what you can do with it
Getting power from this little piece

Sweat, This sweat is firing my brains

You don't know what






When I was told that I will do it my way
Good bye
Well, I was drinking in the demons valley
When I was told that I will do it my way
For how long you want it
This time you have it all yours


t's been said and now it feels like coming
Crazy feeling but you can't deny it, No
You came all the way to tell me nothing
I can't hear you, this goddamned song is fucking loud
Getting very tired answering questions
About my kind of hair, about the way I look
Listen man, it's not the shirt I'm wearing
This is what I am and this is what I do
Keep knockin', keep knockin'
No one is in the house





I woke up dead and I was all alone
Straight ahead what the fuck did I own?
So shoot me one more time
So shoot me ain’t one of your kind

What goes wrong I am sure you don’t dare to find out
What goes wrong I am sure you don’t dare to know
So shoot me one more time
So shoot me ain’t one of your kind

I don’t know about you but sometimes we love to suffer





You thought your life is beautiful
But outside still rains
You thought can't never happened again
But very little has changed
I never want to be alone
Please come and take me away
I never want to feel so black
But I don't remember your name

I am broken but I live through these days
Doesn't matter what you say
I am solid although I look dead

And what if you can't just run now
And what if I rise and hide your sun
And what if you just lost your self
And what if I know exactly who you are

You thought your life is beautiful

But know you're sick of the pain
You try to run away from me
But I am inside your brain
I never want to be alone
Please come and take me away
I never want to feel that black
But I don't remember your face

I am broken but I live through these days
Doesn't matter what you say
I am solid although I look dead

And what if you can't just run now
And what if I rise and hide your sun
And what if you just lost your self now
And what if I know exactly who you are

What if I hide your sun


I killed myself the day that I stopped dreaming
stopped dreaming about you
I'm lost and found but I will keep on screaming
and it's the last thing I'll do
you'll never gonna know
I turned to stone and nothing really saves me
nothing can't save my soul
I've had enough but still is not enough for me
fighting like a dog
you'll never gonna know
I killed myself the day that I stopped dreaming
stopped dreaming about you
I'm lost and found but I will keep on screaming
and it's the last thing I do
you'll never gonna know



Now I know who I am
Now I know what I want
Now I know what I became
And now I know what I did wrong
I gave away to much of myself now babe
Keeping the pain inside so you won't hurt
I took you for I ride you won't forget now babe
You can't run away from yourself
I gave up everything
And I've been everywhere
I've been blow by the wind
And I'm long way from home
I gave away to much of myself now babe
Keeping the pain inside so you won't hurt
I took you for I ride you won't forget now babe
You can't run away from yourself



He rides a road that don't have no end
An open highway without any bends
Tramp and his stallion, alone in a dream
Proud in his colours
As the chromium gleams
On iron horse he flies
On iron horse he gladly dies
Iron horse's his wife, iron horse's his life
He lives his life, he's living it fast
Don't try to hide
When the die have been cast
He rides a whirlwind
That cuts to the bone
Loaded forever and ferociously stoned
On iron horse he flies
On iron horse he gladly dies
Iron horse's his wife, iron horse's his life
Yeah, slide it to me
One day, one day, gonna go for the sun
Together they'll fly on the eternal run
Wasted forever
On speed bikes and booze
Yeah, us and the brothers
Say we're all born to lose



I put my head under my pillow
But my mind just took a trip
All around, all around
All around, all around

I took my image of the mirror
When my body was going too deep
In the ground, in the ground
In the ground, in the ground

So come on, we're lost in space
So come on, let's burn it all
Just like a kick, right in your face
So come on, let's fuck the world

I threw my face of the picture
And you know that's gonna cause
So much pain, so much pain

I take the lies from my truth now
And the circle just goes on
From the vein to the brain
From the vein to the brain

So come on, we're lost in space
So come on, let's burn it all
Just like a kick, right in your face
So come on, let's fuck the world




I don't know if I'm alive or dead
I don't know if it's night or day
I'm so stoned, I'm almost there
So long gone, lost inside my head
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there

Just a burn
From your cigarette on my hand

I don't know if I'm alive or dead
I'm so stoned I'm almost there
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there

Just a burn
From your cigarette on my hand

I don't care if you think I'm bad
I don't know if I'm the worst you had
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there
I don't know I don't care
I don't care what happened there

Just a burn
From your cigarette on my hand






Well you said you're mine
But then you lost your mind
I'm not the only one
But you know I'll hit and run

So have a drink on me
Don't say nothing
So have a drink on me
What ever you like

Well you said I'm yours
But then you lost your way
There is nothing more to do
There is nothing more to say

So have a drink on me
Don't say nothing
So have a drink on me
What ever you like

Well you said you're mine
You're loosing your own time
I'm not the only one
But you know I'll hit and run

So have a drink on me
Don't say nothing
So have a drink on me
What ever you like









You said you love me
Then you shoot me at the back of my head
You said you need me
Then you're pushing me far away

You got me running down the goddamn line again

Last time I said I love you
You left me down in hell
Last time I saw you
You were pretending that I wasn't there

You got me running down the goddamn line again

It must be something that you said
Before you left me last night out there
But now I have to move on
I've got better things to take care

You said you love me
Then you shoot me at the back of my head
You said you need me
Then you're pushing me far away

You got me running down the goddamn line again

It must be something that you said
Before you left me last night out there
But now I have to move on
I've got better things to take care






Send me some roses
On my way home
I don't suppose that
You can kill your god

Send me some flowers
On my wet ground
I never believe that
You can kill your god

Throw me some stones now
On my way down
I never believe that
You can kill your god

You're mine
What's the point of running
What's the point of lying







You think you're breaking
The chain from the wall
But you can't ever leave
The sun that's shining
Will turn to black hole
You're gonna fall inside

Yeah, yeah, yeah

You cannot hide
Forever you know
Already lost your way
You think you're loosing
You can take no more
Nothing for you today

Yeah, yeah, yeah






You dive into the sea
You fly through the sky
You're living in your dream
You never gonna die

The sun will make you strong
The moon will make you cry
The stars will keep you warm
The universe don't lie

But you don't know why

I feel it's been so long
I haven't seen your face
You lost your way again
You left without a trace

Another perfect day
Another goddamn high
Another life to live
Just be without your light

But you don't know why





Vera's face burnt as a memory of bedroom fun
With a ligther and some hairspray
Smoking in the girls' room
Not worse than Shelley's rape behind the McDonald's
By a man she thought was fine, didn't tell anybody
Or maybe back then we just thought that she was getting some

Now we look back and see that she didn't know how
We never thought that we'd get caught up
Stuck in the teenage waste

As we explode
As we explode
As we explode
As we explode

Then getting drunk in the bushes by the road outside the Kmart
Rolling around in them to see if you would get prickled
Slip the acid on your tongue rooftop shopping mall parkade
We couldn't get enough

Then count the stars and the ten million woes
Just you and the universe judging each other
We never knew that we'd get caught up
Stuck in the teenage waste

As we explode
As we explode
As we explode
As we let go

It's a fight, it's a fight and you finally belong
Got a shiner now and it's more than a battle scar
More than a battle scar, such a good, good story to tell
At lunch break, lunch break, lunch break, lunch break
Such a good, good story to tell

You bully, you break, you bully, you break
You fake, you fake, you fake, you fake
You smoke, you toke, you want, you flaunt, you hit it and you're in it and it's spinning

And it's wild
We never thought that we'd get caught up
Stuck in the teenage waste

As we explode
As we explode
As we explode
As we let go

We're counting the stars
We're counting the stars
We're gonna go far, we're gonna go far
We're counting the stars, we're counting the stars
We're not very far, we're not very far

And it's you and me in the open air
It's truth or dare, we don't care
We're counting the stars, we're counting the stars, we're counting the stars, we're counting the stars
