# NLP-sentiment analysis-WordClouds

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from text data, specifically by conducting sentiment analysis and generating visualizations through word clouds. The main objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of the song lyrics of "Nightstalker", a Greek Stoner-Rock band formed in 1980 and one of my personal favorites. More information about the band can be found on their [official page](https://nightstalkerband.com/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Stalker).

## Problem Statement
The project addressed several challenges, including:

* Extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data, specifically song lyrics.
* Conducting sentiment analysis to understand the emotions conveyed by the lyrics.
* Creating visualizations to showcase the most common words and sentiment trends.

## Methodology

* Data Collection: I collected song lyrics by utilizing web scraping methods on the Genius Lyrics website. The dataset comprised lyrics from 8 albums, totaling 73 songs.
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: To ensure accurate analysis, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. This involved removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and eliminating stopwords.
* Word Tokenization: I then tokenized the cleaned lyrics into individual words. This process included removing punctuation marks and stopwords to focus on the relevant words.
* WordCloud Visualization: To visually represent the frequency of words, I created WordClouds. These WordClouds provided a quick overview of the most common words and recurring themes in the lyrics.
* Sentiment Analysis: For sentiment analysis, I employed two libraries: VADER and TextBlob. These libraries helped me determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the lyrics and analyze sentiment trends for both albums and individual songs.
* Visualization of Sentiment Results: To make the sentiment analysis results more accessible, I used various visualization techniques, including bar plots. These visualizations enabled me to highlight sentiment distribution and trends across albums.

## Tasks

1.Data Collection:
* Gathered lyrics data from the Genius Lyrics website using web scraping techniques.
* Stored the collected lyrics in text files for further analysis.
  
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
* Removed punctuation marks and converted text to lowercase.
* Eliminated stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
  
3.Word Tokenization:
* Tokenized the cleaned lyrics into individual words.
* Created a list of unique words to analyze.
  
4.WordCloud Visualization:
* Generated WordClouds to visually present common words within the lyrics.
* Extracted recurring themes from the WordClouds.
  
5.Sentiment Analysis:
* Utilized VADER and TextBlob libraries for sentiment analysis.
* Determined the overall sentiment of both lyrics and individual songs.
* Calculated polarity and subjectivity scores.
  
6.Visualization of Sentiment Results:
* Created bar plots to visualize sentiment distribution across albums.
* Compared sentiment outcomes from both VADER and TextBlob libraries.

## Business Value
This project offers tangible benefits by showcasing the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights from song lyrics. The project's significance lies in:

* Enhanced Decision Making: By effectively implementing NLP, the project provides a model for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. This capability can be applied across various domains to make more informed decisions.
* Optimized Customer Understanding: The sentiment analysis component of the project highlights the potential of NLP to gauge customer sentiment. Businesses can leverage this insight to tailor products and services to customer preferences and feedback.
* Improved Marketing Strategies: The visualization of frequently used words in lyrics can guide marketing campaigns by identifying recurring themes and sentiments. This can help companies align their messaging with what resonates most with their audience.
* Data-Driven Creativity: The project's creative application of NLP to music lyrics demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance creative processes. Businesses can harness similar techniques to innovate products, content, and user experiences.
* Efficient Resource Allocation: NLP's ability to process and analyze large volumes of text efficiently can be applied to automate tasks like sentiment analysis in customer feedback. This streamlines operations and allows resources to be allocated more effectively.
* Insights from Unstructured Data: The project's success in extracting insights from unstructured text showcases the potential of NLP for tapping into a goldmine of data that businesses often overlook.
