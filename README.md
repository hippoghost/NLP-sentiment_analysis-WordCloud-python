# python_NLP

The thought process for this project is to Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mining information from text and provide insights through sentiment analysis and visualization.
The end purpose is to conduct an extensive analysis in music lyrics in one of my favorite bands, "Nightstalker", a Greek Stoner-Rock band formed in 1980.

In this project,I aimed to answer the following questions:

Are music lyrics appropriate for text analysis?

Is it possible for music lyrics to be visualized?

Could I get any meaningful insights?

What kind of sentiments are expressed through lyrics?

Which words are constantly being repeated in a music album?
