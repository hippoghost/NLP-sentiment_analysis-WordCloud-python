# NLP-sentiment analysis-WordClouds

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from text data, specifically by conducting sentiment analysis and generating visualizations through word clouds. The main objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of the song lyrics of "Nightstalker", a Greek Stoner-Rock band formed in 1980 and one of my personal favorites. More information about the band can be found on their [official page](https://nightstalkerband.com/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Stalker).

## Problem Statement
The project addressed several challenges, including:

* Extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data, specifically song lyrics.
* Conducting sentiment analysis to understand the emotions conveyed by the lyrics.
* Creating visualizations to showcase the most common words and sentiment trends.

## Methodology & Tasks

1. Data Collection: 
Lyrics were scraped from the Genius Lyrics website, resulting in a dataset of 73 songs across 8 albums.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The lyrics underwent comprehensive cleaning, including removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and eliminating insignificant stopwords.

3. Word Tokenization: Cleaned lyrics were tokenized into individual words, with punctuation marks and stopwords discarded.

4. WordCloud Visualization: WordClouds visually represent word frequency, aiding in identifying common words and recurring themes within the lyrics.

5. Sentiment Analysis: Leveraging VADER and TextBlob libraries, the project determined overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the lyrics and analyzed sentiment trends for albums and songs.

6. Visualization of Sentiment Results: Sentiment analysis outcomes were presented visually, using techniques like bar plots, to illustrate sentiment distribution across albums.

## Business Value

This project offers tangible benefits by showcasing the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights from song lyrics. The project's significance lies in:

* Enhanced Decision Making: By effectively implementing NLP, the project provides a model for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. This capability can be applied across various domains to make more informed decisions.
* Optimized Customer Understanding: The sentiment analysis component of the project highlights the potential of NLP to gauge customer sentiment. Businesses can leverage this insight to tailor products and services to customer preferences and feedback.
* Improved Marketing Strategies: The visualization of frequently used words in lyrics can guide marketing campaigns by identifying recurring themes and sentiments. This can help companies align their messaging with what resonates most with their audience.
* Data-Driven Creativity: The project's creative application of NLP to music lyrics demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance creative processes. Businesses can harness similar techniques to innovate products, content, and user experiences.
* Efficient Resource Allocation: NLP's ability to process and analyze large volumes of text efficiently can be applied to automate tasks like sentiment analysis in customer feedback. This streamlines operations and allows resources to be allocated more effectively.
* Insights from Unstructured Data: The project's success in extracting insights from unstructured text showcases the potential of NLP for tapping into a goldmine of data that businesses often overlook.
