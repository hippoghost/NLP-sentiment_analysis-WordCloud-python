# NLP-sentiment analysis-WordClouds

## PROJECT OVERVIEW


The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from text data, specifically by conducting sentiment analysis and generating visualizations through word clouds. The main objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of the song lyrics of "Nightstalker", a Greek Stoner-Rock band formed in 1980 and one of my personal favorites. More information about the band can be found on their official website and on Wikipedia. [official page](https://nightstalkerband.com/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Stalker).

## DATA

All data was collected using web scraping techniques with the Genius API from GENIUS.COM. The lyrics of the band's songs were saved as text files. The data consists of:

*8 albums with 73 songs (4 of them instrumental), totaling 3.326 words, but only 770 of them are unique.

## QUESTIONS

In this project,I aimed to answer the following questions:

* Are music lyrics appœÅŒøpriate for text analysis?
* Can music lyrics be effectively visualized?
* What meaningful insights can be gained from analyzing song lyrics?
* What sentiments are expressed through lyrics?
* Which words are frequently repeated in a music album?
