# NLP-sentiment analysis-WordClouds

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The thought process for this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine information from text and provide insights through sentiment analysis and visualization.
The end purpose is to conduct an extensive analysis in song lyrics of one of my favorite bands, "Nightstalker", a Greek Stoner-Rock band formed in 1980. More information can be found in the [official page](https://nightstalkerband.com/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Stalker).



**DATA**

All data was collected through web scraping techniques using geniusapi from [GENIUS.COM](https://genius.com/)Â . The band's lyrics were saved as text files. 

The data consists of:

Â· 8 albums containing 73 songs (4 of them are instrumental),a total of 3.326 words but only 770 of them are unique.

**QUESTIONS**

In this project,I aimed to answer the following questions:

* Are music lyrics apporpriate for text analysis?
* Is it possible for music lyrics to be visualized?
* Could i get any meaningful insights?
* What kind of sentiments are expressed through lyrics?
* Which words are constantly being repeated in a music album?
